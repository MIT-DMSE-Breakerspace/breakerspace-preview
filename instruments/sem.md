# Thermo Fisher Phenom Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEM)

## Overview

The Breakerspace has two scanning electron microscopes (SEM): a Thermo Fisher [Phenom XL](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/electron-microscopy/products/desktop-scanning-electron-microscopes/phenom-xl.html) and a Thermo Fisher [Phenom Pure](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/electron-microscopy/products/desktop-scanning-electron-microscopes/phenom-pure.html).

[SEMs](https://www.thermofisher.com/blog/materials/what-is-sem-scanning-electron-microscopy-explained/) use a focused beam of electrons to image materials at much higher magnification than can be achieved with an optical microscope. In good conditions, the Phenom instruments can resolve features on the order of 100 nm.

SEM users must complete Breakerspace lab training and SEM-specific training before working independently. If your sample is hazardous, wet, very magnetic, loose, reactive, biological, vacuum-sensitive, or otherwise unusual, ask staff before bringing it to the lab.

### Interactive SEM Chooser

Use this quick chooser if you are not sure which SEM to reserve. The recommendation is a starting point; ask staff if your sample is unusual or the result seems ambiguous.

<div id="sem-chooser" style="border:1px solid #d0d0d0; padding:1em; margin:1em 0;">
  <p><label><input type="checkbox" id="sem-eds"> I need EDS elemental analysis.</label></p>
  <p><label><input type="checkbox" id="sem-large"> My sample is larger than an 18 mm stub, unusually shaped, or I want to load multiple stubs.</label></p>
  <p><label><input type="checkbox" id="sem-cold"> My sample is wet, frozen, heat-sensitive, or needs the cold stage.</label></p>
  <p><label><input type="checkbox" id="sem-routine"> I only need routine imaging of a small, dry, mounted sample.</label></p>

### Choose An SEM

| Use case | Recommended instrument | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Large samples, multiple stubs, or awkward geometry | [Phenom XL](./phenom-xl.html) | Stage accepts samples up to 100 mm x 100 mm x 35 mm. Confirm height before loading. |
| Elemental analysis | [Phenom XL](./phenom-xl.html) | Use EDS for spot checks, maps, reports, and CSV exports. |
| Fast imaging of ordinary dry samples | [Phenom XL](./phenom-xl.html) or [Phenom Pure](./phenom-pure.html) | Choose based on availability and holder compatibility. |
| Frozen, wet, or beam-sensitive samples | [Phenom Pure](./phenom-pure.html) | Use the temperature-controlled cold stage after staff-approved sample prep. |
| One small mounted stub | [Phenom Pure](./phenom-pure.html) | Useful for straightforward imaging when EDS is not needed. |
| Non-conductive samples | Phenom XL or Phenom Pure | Use low vacuum, sputter coating, or conductive mounting depending on the goal. |

For EDS samples on the Phenom XL, prefer conductive mounting and avoid coating materials that interfere with the elements of interest. Gold coating is excellent for imaging but can complicate EDS; carbon coating is often better for inorganic EDS.

### Shared Sample Preparation Details

SEM sample preparation has two goals: protect the microscope and make the sample electrically and mechanically stable enough to image. The most common preventable SEM problems are loose debris, incorrect height, poor grounding, wet samples, and over-prepared samples that no longer show the surface you wanted to study.

#### Basic Solid Samples

1. Place a clean bare stub in a sample prep tray.
2. Attach a double-sided carbon pad or another approved adhesive.
3. Attach the sample firmly to the pad.
4. If useful, add conductive tape, conductive paint, or graphite/silver paint to connect the sample surface to the metal stub.
5. Use stub tweezers to hold the stub, then gently tap and blow with compressed air to remove loose particles.
6. Confirm the sample is not taller than the instrument-specific height limit before loading.

Do not prepare samples inside an SEM sample holder. Loose particles can fall into the holder or loading area and later contaminate the detector, chamber, or column.

#### Powder And Particle Samples

Powders should be sparse, well attached, and mostly one layer thick.

1. Attach a carbon pad to a clean stub.
2. Pick up a very small amount of powder with a toothpick, spatula, or tweezers.
3. Gently brush or flick particles onto the exposed carbon pad.
4. Press particles lightly into the adhesive if needed.
5. Hold the stub with stub tweezers, tap the side of the stub, then blow with compressed air to remove loose grains.

If you care about particle size or shape, thick piles are a problem because particles overlap and hide each other. Use less material than feels natural; SEM needs a visible population of particles, not a mound.

#### Non-Conductive Samples

Non-conductive samples can charge under the electron beam. Charging often appears as a region that gets brighter over time, streaks, distorted features, drifting image position, or a field of view that washes out to white.

You have three main options:

1. **Low vacuum:** fastest and non-destructive. Useful for paper, polymers, ceramics, many organics, and samples where coating is not acceptable. Resolution and signal-to-noise will usually be worse than high vacuum.
2. **Sputter coating:** best for high-resolution imaging of insulating surfaces. Gold is common and highly conductive, but it adds a coating that can hide very fine surface features and complicate elemental analysis.
3. **Conductive bridge:** copper tape, carbon tape, graphite paint, or silver paint can provide a partial path to ground. This works best when the area of interest is close to the conductive bridge.

#### Wet, Moist, And Biological Samples

Wet samples are risky in an SEM because water and other volatile liquids outgas under vacuum. Outgassing can cause poor images, vacuum errors, contamination, and microscope damage.

Common strategies:

* **Dry the sample** if preserving the wet structure is not important.
* **Use the sputter coater drying/vacuum mode** to test whether a sample visibly changes under vacuum before loading it into the SEM.
* **Freeze the sample** on the Phenom Pure cold stage if you need to preserve wet or heat-sensitive structure.
* **Use a very small amount in low vacuum** only when staff agree that the sample is appropriate and low moisture enough.

### Exercises

These exercises are shared SEM examples. The instrument-specific pages identify which exercise is best for training on each SEM.

* **Level 1 - General training:** Prepare and image a small piece of hair. Use the Phenom Pure or XL to load the sample, navigate with NavCam, focus in LiveSEM, acquire images at several magnifications, and compare a cut end with a torn or broken end.
* **Level 2 - EDS practice:** Prepare salt and sugar on the same stub. Use morphology first, then EDS on the Phenom XL, to decide which is which.
* **Level 2 - Non-conductive sample comparison:** Image an uncoated non-conductive sample in low vacuum, then sputter coat a similar sample and compare resolution, charging, and surface contrast.
* **Level 2 - Image analysis:** Cut a thin slice of a roasted coffee bean, sputter coat it, and image pore structure. Estimate average cavity size from several images.
* **Level 3 - Specialist training:** Prepare a powder sample sparse enough for particle sizing. Acquire images suitable for measuring particle diameter and compare the result with a poorly dispersed sample.
* **Level 3 - Specialist training:** Use the Phenom Pure cold stage on a staff-approved wet or heat-sensitive sample. Document the freezing temperature, imaging behavior, and signs of frost, outgassing, or beam damage.
